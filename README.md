# ParseTree
Included in this repo/modual are a class-based binary tree structure, as well as a function, parseTree, that returns a binary tree. parseTree takes a string-form mathematical expression, and returns a binary tree for which the root values / keys of each node are either parentheses, +-*/ operators, or integers. We then implement a function, evalTree, that evaluates the expression stored in our tree. I was working through Miller &amp; Ranum when working on this, and made a few amendments. Whereas Miller &amp; Ranum did not include parent functionality in their BinaryTree class, and thus had to implement stacks in their parseTree function, I chose to instead include parent node functionality in my BinaryTree class, and thus avoid having to utilize stacks in my parseTree function.
